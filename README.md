# ELTRA: An Embedding Method based on Learning-to-Rank to Preserve Asymmetric Information in Directed Graphs

This repository provides a reference implementation of ELTRA as well as access to the data.

## Installation and usage
ELTRA is a novel similarity-based double-vector **E**mbedding method based on listwise Learning-**T**o-**R**ank (LTR) that preserves **A**symmetric information in directed graphs. It is straightforward embedding method implemented by a simple deep neural network consisting of only a projection layer and an output layer.

This repository will be updated soon. 

Thank you
